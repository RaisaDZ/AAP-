AmesHousing_shuffle1.R - code for reproducing results of Parallel copies of AA for Ames housing data set 
with monthly linear regression experts built for the first year of the data.

Output file losses_shuffle1.csv - total losses of AA with parallel copies for each random 
permutation of observations within the month. First value of total loss uses the original
order from the data set.
